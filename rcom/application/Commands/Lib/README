Each param rahl_commander can get, is represented by an object here, which has a defined action.
Each time we call a rahl_commander command, it will be parsed into a series of commands (letters)
which will be executed as a word/sentence.
list -d dhara -s baba -l
will instantiate the Commands_List_Parser
which will build the word/coomand/sentence from
Commands_List_d
Commands_List_l
Commands_List_s

and execute them.
