Purpose of this directory:
==========================

config/environments
Providing the environemnt values for each machine u deploy Rahl Commander on. Will enable u to have different settings on different machines, prod/dev/qa.
Each machine will have a different env file.

config/
Providing system specific configuration. Those are values which are specific to your product, and should be same through out you deployment environments.
It is highly not suggested to use one copy of Rahl Commander to more than one project.

==========================================================================================================================================================

config/environments

Machine Name
============
Which environment is to be used is decided by an rahl_environment_name file which contains the env name.
Where u put this file is your choice. By default, it will look for it under /etc/ 

Instructions for default  behavior:
1. Create file /etc/rahl_environment_name. Make sure it has read persmission to the user who runs Rahl Commander.
   If u whish to put rahl_environment_name in a different place (strongly suggested outside of this project directories), then modify
   the right place in application/bootstrap.php
2. In that file put a string (no spaces or stange characters, please) which identifies you current environment. For example "development_me". 
   An example file is located in this folder (config/), u can copy it to /etc/rahl_environment_name.
   As u can see, there are **NO** white chars around the environment name (in the file).
3. Under /config/environments/ make sure u have a file with the same name as the content of /etc/rahl_environment_name.
   In our case, it would be called development_me.json (An example file is there).
4. Copy the example file to be the name you chose for your environment, or, if u use the example file env name, modify it directly.
   The values in it are pretty self explanatory.
